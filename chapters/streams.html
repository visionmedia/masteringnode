<h1>Streams</h1>
<p> Streams are an important concept in node. The stream api is a unified way to handle stream-like data, for example data can be streamed to a file, streamed to a socket to respond to an HTTP request, or a stream can be read-only such as reading from <em>stdin</em>. However since we will be touching on stream specifics in later chapters, for now we will concentrate on the api.</p>

<h2 id="Readable-Streams">Readable Streams</h2>

<p> Readable streams such as an HTTP request inherit from <code>EventEmitter</code> in order to expose incoming data through events. The first of these events is the <em>data</em> event, which is an arbitrary chunk of data passed to the event handler as a <code>Buffer</code> instance.</p>

<pre><code>req.on('data', function(buf){
    // Do something with the Buffer
});
</code></pre>

<p>As we know, we can call <code>toString()</code> a buffer to return a string representation of the binary data, however in the case of streams if desired we may call <code>setEncoding()</code> on the stream,
after which the <em>data</em> event will emit strings.</p>

<pre><code>req.setEncoding('utf8');
req.on('data', function(str){
    // Do something with the String
});
</code></pre>

<p>Another import event is the <em>end</em> event, which represents the ending of <em>data</em> events. For example below we define an HTTP echo server, simply "pumping" the request body data through to the response. So if we <strong>POST</strong> "hello world", our response will be "hello world".</p>

<pre><code>var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(req, res){
    res.writeHead(200);
    req.on('data', function(data){
        res.write(data);
    });
    req.on('end', function(){
        res.end();
    });
}).listen(3000);
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>sys</em> module actually has a function designed specifically for this "pumping" action, aptly named <code>sys.pump()</code>, which accepts a read stream as the first argument, and write stream as the second.</p>

<pre><code>var http = require('http'),
    sys = require('sys');

http.createServer(function(req, res){
    res.writeHead(200);
    sys.pump(req, res);
}).listen(3000);
</code></pre>
